Credit Card Revenue Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict revenue from credit card transactions using a Random Forest Regressor. The project involved preprocessing data, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance. Integrated PostgreSQL for data management and visualized insights with Plotly and Matplotlib. Deployed the solution as a Streamlit web application for easy interaction and predictions.

Skills: Machine Learning, Random Forest, Data Preprocessing, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, Python, Data Visualization
